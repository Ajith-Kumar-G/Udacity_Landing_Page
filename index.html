            Objective: <br>
            The objective of Snake Mania is to control the snake and guide it to eat as much food as possible while
            avoiding collisions with the snake's own body or the game boundaries. The primary goal is to achieve the
            highest score by growing the snake as long as possible.

          <div id="food_pixel"></div> -- Food
          <p>
          Controls: <br>

          Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) or swipe gestures (on touch devices) to control the movement
          of the snake.
          The snake will continuously move in the direction specified until a new direction is chosen. </p>
          <p>Gameplay:
            <br>

          <ul>
            <p>
              <li>When the game starts, the snake is placed in the center of the game area.</li>
              <li>
                Food items appear at random locations within the game boundaries. The snake must move over the food to
                consume it and grow.</li>
              <li>
                Each time the snake consumes food, it increases in length by one cell.</li>
              <li>
                The score increases with each food item eaten.</li>
              <li>
                The game ends if any of the following conditions occur:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The snake collides with its own body, indicating a self-collision.</li>
                  <li>
                    The snake collides with the boundaries of the game area.
